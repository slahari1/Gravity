Every day I discover something new

People often say that you know yourself better than anyone else. I think that I'm still learning a lot about myself as I grow and change.
I'm beginning to understand what I truly like and dislike--what I find my self gravitating towards, and what I find is a waste of time. 
I don't like to pressure myself into doing something I don't want because I think it will please others or I feel obligated to because of society.
I'm rediscovering reading for pleasure and enjoying words and thoughts that aren't marked with academic weight. I feel at ease when I paint and draw 
letting my mind wander as I listen to my favorite albums on repeat. I lose track of time in my own world and as in introvert I revel in this introspective
quiet realm of mine. But then I miss my friends and we talk and laugh and I'm filled with the warmth of friendship that only the closest people to me can bring.
This summer I'm really taking the time to figure myself out and decide what I really want from my future, but I think I've learned to cherish the small 
feats and moments as well.

I'd like to end this with something I felt good about today. I was surrounded by the bustle and chatter of family and I had a great conversation with my mom
and that made me very happy.

I am inspired by the writing of my dear friend Kristen Luft, who puts her heart and soul into every word she pours onto the page. This is her blog:

I highly recommend reading!
