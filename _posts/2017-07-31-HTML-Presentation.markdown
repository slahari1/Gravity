This assignment we created a presentation using HTML. The framework is called Reveal. I thoroughly enjoyed making my presentation and I will definitely continue to use Reveal in the future.

My presentation was about experiencing art pieces while engaging more deeply in a holistic experience. So each of my slides contained a work of art. Each piece was associated with words that I had written and music that I had downloaded and found to complement the work of art. This was to allow the viewer to engage visually, audially, and mentally. I think the presentation turned out quite well! I found working with audacity simple and interesting. I liked adding fade in/fade out effects on the mp3s to allow for better transitions. Overall I think my experience with Reveal and HTML was a positive one!
