<h2>A Little About Me</h2>
<p>I am a junior at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill! I am pursuing a Computer Science B.A and a Cognitive Science minor. 
My Myers-Briggs personality type is INFP. I often overthink things and get anxious about silly stuff. I am kind of shy at first but 
I am an outspoken and loyal friend once I have become comfortable! I am an intersectional feminist and I am unafraid to tell you about it. I love food, art, and music and it shows in everything that I do. I'll get 
into the details of what I like and dislike next!

<h3>Music I Like</h3>>
<p>I have a pretty eclectic taste in music. I listen to a lot of different styles and genres, anywhere from electronic-trap to jazz and symphonic. 
I have been particularly interested in k-pop, as I recently learned more about the culture and language. Some artists that I quite like are Norah Jones, 
Blackbear, BTS, Chance the Rapper, Kendrick Lamar, Nat King Cole, and Khalid.
